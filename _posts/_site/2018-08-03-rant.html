<p>Have you ever tried to make an account or register for something, and this hideous box comes across your screen?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/robo.png" /></p>

<p>I think it’s ridiculous and must be stopped. Hear me out:</p>

<p>Every time you click one of those boxes to make sure you know what a fuckin house or street sign looks like you’re training Google’s AI. Who knows what they could build with all sorts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#Image_recognition">tagged and pretrained images</a>. Probably using them for <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>, but because that info is proprietary they could easily repurpose it for other tech.</p>

<p>You’re also making these people smarter and richer.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that. <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Ming-Jack-Po">Jack</a> is a real sweetheart and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KjOV76MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Hector</a> is an Emmy award winning machine learning / big data engineer!</p>

<p>My argument is that it’s seems unfair to consumers and is honestly a giant time suck. I often have to redo these things a couple times to make sure I’m not a robot beepboop010101 o shit sorry there I almost lost my marbles.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think Google should change this. We’ll see how they respond.</p>

<p>In the meantime, could you make this blog post trending? Share on Facebook for me, because I avoid that site harder than a 15th century serf’s bubonic plague infested toe.</p>

<p>It’s not like Google doesn’t have enough information on everyone and everything. Seems a bit ridiculous that they need free, part time consultants from around training their AI. It’s an evil plan but it’s <em>so genius</em>.</p>

<p>That being said, it’s probably our best type of technology for determining if someone is actually behind a screen. Especially considering all the myriad businesses that rely on legitimate human connection to deal with customers.</p>

<p>I think there has to be viable alternatives out there. No idea what they look like, but for sure there are alternatives. Ya’ll got any ideas? Email me!</p>

<p>&lt;3 you (yes you reading this)</p>
