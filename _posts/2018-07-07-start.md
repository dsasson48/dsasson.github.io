Hi everyone! Thanks for all your support on this website which nurtures my budding data science career and general education. 

This is just a announcment that I intend to build something with the [Harvard innovation labs](https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/) next semester. If you're curious about learning more, collaboration, or investing ;) please shoot me an email [here](mailto:dsasson@hsph.harvard.edu).
