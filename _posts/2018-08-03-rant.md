Have you ever tried to make an account or register for something, and this hideous box comes across your screen?

I think it’s ridiculous and must be stopped. Hear me out:

Every time you click one of those boxes to make sure you know what a fuckin house or street sign looks like you’re training Google’s AI. Who knows what they could build with all sorts of [tagged and pretrained images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#Image_recognition). Probably using them for [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), but because that info is proprietary they could easily repurpose it for other tech. 

You’re also making these people smarter and richer.

Nothing wrong with that. [Jack](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ming-Jack-Po) is a real sweetheart and [Hector](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KjOV76MAAAAJ&hl=en) is an Emmy award winning machine learning / big data engineer!

My argument is that it’s seems unfair to consumers and is honestly a giant time suck. I often have to redo these things a couple times to make sure I’m not a robot beepboop010101 o shit sorry there I almost lost my marbles. 

Anyway, I think Google should change this. We’ll see how they respond.

In the meantime, could you make this blog post trending? Share on Facebook for me, because I avoid that site harder than a 15th century serf’s bubonic plague infested toe. 

It’s not like Google doesn’t have enough information on everyone and everything. Seems a bit ridiculous that they need free, part time consultants from around training their AI. It’s an evil plan but it’s _so genius_. 

That being said, it’s probably our best type of technology for determining if someone is actually behind a screen. Especially considering all the myriad businesses that rely on legitimate human connection to deal with customers. 

I think there has to be viable alternatives out there. No idea what they look like, but for sure there are alternatives. Ya’ll got any ideas? Email me!

<3 you (yes you reading this)
