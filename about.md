        <p>I'm a graduate student at the <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health</a> studying <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/case-data-scientists-inside-health-care/">Health Data Science</a>. I recently graduated from <a href="https://macaulay.cuny.edu/">Macaulay Honors College</a>, and narrowly avioided a Cornell transfer (thank god, Ithaca sucks). Dislikes: black pepper, intolerance, scars without stories. Likes: limes, mountains, cooking videos. Thanks for reading!</p>
